Here are steps on how to create a custom protocol.

1. Click Win + R to open run.
2. Type into the bar "regedit.exe".
3. Allow Registry Editor to make changes to your device.
4. Right click HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.
5. Click New > Key.
6. Name your key to what you want the protocol to be.
7. Add a new string value and call it "URL Protocol".
8. Double click the new string and type in "URL:(name of key) Protocol".
9. Right click the key and add a new key called "shell".
10. Add another key inside shell called "open".
11. Add another key inside oepn called "command".
12. Now edit the (Default) string.
13. Set the value to "(application or file location)"
14. Now you're done! Go to the address bar and type in "(protocol name)://" and it should pop up saying something like open this application. If it doesn't work you might need to remove the "%1" or make sure the URL Protocol and key are the same name.

If you want to tell the application what was typed you add "%1" to step 13 after the other string.
